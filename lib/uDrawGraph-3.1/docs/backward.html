  <H1>Backward compatibility of uDraw(Graph) 3.1</H1>
  
  <P>
    Starting with uDraw(Graph) 3.1 our product has a new name. Formerly it
    was known as daVinci (V1.0 to V2.1) or daVinci
    Presenter 3.0.x (supported and maintained by the company b-novative GmbH).
    Due to a trademark conflict we are not allowed to use the name
    daVinci longer than the year 2006. Therefore we have decided
    to rename our software to uDraw(Graph) immediately.
  </P>
  <P>
    Unfortunately the name daVinci was used in several places of
    the program and therefore we had to change some system features that
    affect all users. Our usual backward compatibilty mode allows you
    to use your old applications and your old graphs without any changes. But
    it is recommended to change all the occurences of daVinci in
    your applications to be prepared for the year 2007.
  </P>
   <P>
    <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> We do not guarantee that the backward compatibility
    mode explained on this page is integrated in our software longer than
    December 31, 2006.
  </P>
   <P>
    The following changes have been made to the system:
  </P>
  <UL>
  <LI>
  <B>Renamed binaries</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    The binary of uDraw(Graph) is now called uDrawGraph(.exe) and can be found
    and executed in the "bin" directory of the distribution. Additionally
    we had to rename the tool "gml2daVinci" to
    <A href="tool.html#gml2udg" target="_top">"gml2udg"</A>, it can
    be found in the same directory. For backward compatibility there should
    be links in the "bin" directory with the old names of the binaries.
  </P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <B>Renamed environment variables</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    Nearly all <A href="var.html" target="_top">environment variables</A> had to be
    renamed. The main variable to specify the location of the uDraw(Graph)
    distribution directory is now called
    <A href="var.html#udg_home" target="_top">UDG_HOME</A>. The other two variables
    are called <A href="var.html#udg_icondir" target="_top">UDG_ICONDIR</A> and
    <A href="var.html#udg_lang" target="_top">UDG_LANG</A> now. But if you still
    use the old variable names uDraw(Graph) will use them until you set the
    new ones (recommended!).
  </P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <B>File name suffix for graph files is now ".udg"</B>
<BR>
    <P>
    Formerly we have used the suffix ".daVinci" for graph files. This
    has been changed to ".udg". All files in the "samples/graphs" directory of
    the distribution have been renamed. But the
    <A href="gui_file_open.html" target="_top">File/Open... dialog</A> will still
    load and show *.daVinci files if you choose type "Graph Files".
    If the backward compatibility mode discovers an old suffix in the file
    that should be opened and you have the right to rename it, a dialog
    window appears to ask you if renaming should be done for this file
    automatically.
    </P>
  <P>
  <IMG border="0" alt="Renaming Question" width="" height="" src="uDG31_back_ask.gif" align="JUSTIFY">    
  </P>
  <P>
    Just say "Yes" or "No" as you like or "No, don't ask again" if you don't
    want to be asked this question again. If you use the menu
    <A href="gui_opt.html#save" target="_top">Option/Save Options</A> after selecting
    "No, don't ask again" your decision is rembered forever.
  </P>
  <P>
    New graph files are always stored with the new suffix in the
    <A href="gui_file_save.html" target="_top">File/Save... dialog</A>.
  </P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <B>Renamed and changed API commands</B>
<BR>
  <P>
  The API command menu(view(daVinci_info)) is now
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#view_uDrawGraph_info" target="_top">menu(view(uDrawGraph_info))</A>. But as expected the old command still works.
  </P>
  <P>
    The API command
    <A href="api_cmd_special.html#version" target="_top">special(version)</A>
    now answers
    <A href="api_answ_all.html#version" target="_top">version("uDraw(Graph) 3.1")</A>.
  </P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <B>Changes in the Tcl/Tk interface</B>
<BR>
  <P>
  In the <A href="api_tcl.html" target="_top">Tcl/Tk interface</A> the
  "daVinci" command has been renamed to "uDrawGraph". But using the
  old name of the command will still work.
  </P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <B>Renamed internal files</B>
<BR>
  <P>
  uDraw(Graph) stores two internal files in the users home directory. These are
  named "$HOME/.uDrawGraph" for the options saved with menu
  <A href="gui_opt.html#save" target="_top">Option/Save Options</A> and
  "$HOME/.uDrawGraph&lt;VERSION&gt;" to rember that the user has already accepted
  the license conditions for the current &lt;VERSION&gt;. uDraw(Graph) will still load the options file with
  the old name "$HOME/.daVinci" until the user first saves the
  options in uDraw(Graph).
