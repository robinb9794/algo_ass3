    The uDraw(Graph) user interface can be configured for most languages 
    in order to provide native texts for the end user.
    The system is pre-configured for English (default) and German locales,
    but the text output of the user interface can be customized by 
    experienced users to show character sets that are supported by the 
    Unicode/UTF-8 encoding.
    Note that the layout of dialog windows cannot be manipulated, which might
    be inconvenient for languages not written from left to right. 
    All text elements of the user interface are stored in plain language 
    files that can be edited by the user.
  </P>

  <H2>
    Basics: Language Files and Language Keys
  </H2>
  <P>
    A language file contains a mapping between language keys and 
    language values (both strings), so one key/value pair occurs in 
    each line of the file.
    The value is the translation of the corresponding key for the 
    particular language.

  <P>
    A separate language file is used for all available languages.
    The set of keys is identical in all files, so only the values may 
    vary. A particular language file is chosen at initialization time
    by considering environment variable
  <A href="var.html#udg_lang" target="_top">$UDG_LANG</A>, 
  <A href="int.html#language_files" target="_top">see below</A>.
    The language file is loaded into a translation table when starting 
    uDraw(Graph).
    All text messages, buttons, menus etc. are represented by language
    keys internally. 
    When a particular text (language key) has to be displayed, it is 
    first converted into the native language according to the 
    translation table.
  </P>

  <P>
    This mechanism for internationalization can even be used by 
  <A href="api.html" target="_top">uDraw(Graph) applications</A>. 
    With command
  <A href="api_cmd_special.html#add_language" target="_top">special(add_language(...))</A>,
    the application can provide an additional language file with
    its own language keys and values.
    When the application 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">extends</A>
    or
  <A href="api_gui_config.html" target="_top">configures</A>
    the uDraw(Graph) user interface by its own menus, icons etc., 
    it can use the language keys (from both the application and 
    preconfigured language files) for particular string parameters
    which are marked with type
  <A href="api_param.html#lang_string" target="_top">lang_string</A>
    in the grammar for
  <A href="api_cmd.html" target="_top">API commands</A>
    and 
  <A href="api_gui_config_syntax.html" target="_top">configuration files</A>.
    Language keys can be used in a string parameter by starting with
    an initial "#%" sequence, followed by the key as it is written 
    in the language file.
    You cannot use the language key inside of a larger string.
    Here is an example showing how to use a language key in the
    string parameter of an API command:

  <A name="language_files"></A>
  <H2>
    Position and naming of language files
  </H2>
  <P>
    The recommended default directory for all language files is directory 
    "$UDG_HOME/lib/uDrawGraph". 
    When uDraw(Graph) is started, it looks for the language file 
    in the current start directory and afterwards in the default directory.
    The system will not start if it cannot find at least one language
    file according to the following selection rules.
  </P>
  <P>
    All language file names look like "uDrawGraph_C.lang". This can be 
    split into three parts, where the first one ("uDrawGraph_") and
    the last one (".lang") are fixed and the second part is the 
    current language setting ("C" in this case which is the default 
    language).
    The current language is retrieved from environment variable
  <A href="var.html#udg_lang" target="_top">$UDG_LANG</A>.
    So for example you can switch to the German user interface
    by setting "$UDG_LANG" to value "de" before starting uDraw(Graph).
    This will use the language file "uDrawGraph_de.lang", located in the
    default directory.
    After the start, the language setting is fixed.
  </P>

  <A name="syntax"></A>
  <H2>
    Syntax and Layout of Language Files
  </H2>
  <P>
    The syntax of language files is very easy. 
    At each line of the file, you have to use exactly two strings 
    that are separated by white space.
    The first string is the language key and the second string is 
    the language value, see 
  <A href="int.html#language_key" target="_top">example above</A>.
    Please enclose the language value in double quotes, although 
    this is only necessary when the the value contains white space.
    So in the example above, it would be a failure to replace
    the bullets by white space (e.g. no keys like "PrintDlg Landscape").
  </P>
  <P>
    The language keys you can find in the "uDrawGraph_C.lang" default 
    file are hard coded in uDraw(Graph), so if you want to provided an
    additional translation file, make sure that you keep the keys
    as is, especially the exact number.
    Some keys with particular endings have a special semantic, 
    whereas all others may have an arbitrary string as value. 
    For keys ending with ".mne", the value has to be an integer
    which specifies the position of the character that should be 
    underlined in a menu and used as a mnemonic (see section about
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#menu_entry" target="_top">user interface configuration</A>
    for more information).
    Here, a value of "-1" means no mnemonic. 
    The keys ending with ".mod" define the modifier key used for 
    keyboard bindings of menus and should only have the values 
    Control, Meta, Alt, Shift or "" (for no modifier).
    The accelerator for the keyboard binding is defined by 
    the language keys ending with ".acc".
    Their value should contain only a single character. 
    Please note that accelerators have to be mutually exclusive 
    with respect to the complete user interface and mnemonics 
    have to be mutually exclusive for each menu.
  </P>
  <P>
    To avoid mistakes, it is recommended to copy the standard 
    language file "uDrawGraph_C.lang" in the default directory 
  (<A href="int.html#language_files" target="_top">see above</A>)
    as a basis for a new language file.
  </P>

  <A name="preconditions"></A>
  <H2>
    Preconditions for Language Files
  </H2>
  <P>
    Every language file is checked against the default language file,
    so even if your actual language setting is different, the default
    file ("uDrawGraph_C.lang") must always be present to be used as 
    reference.
    So make sure that you do not edit the default file in order to 
    avoid serious problems.
    Each language file must declare a special key "Version" with the
    uDraw(Graph) version number the file is written for.
    The required number of language keys is hard coded in uDraw(Graph),
    so make sure that your own language files matches the default file
    with respect to the exact number and name of keys.
    A language value must be specified for all language keys in the 
    file.
