  <H1>Programmer's Guide for API Users</H1>
  
  <P>
    The following is an overview of the API for programmers who want 
    to connect their application with uDraw(Graph). 
  </P>

  <H2>Commands of the API</H2>
  <P>
    After connecting your application program with uDraw(Graph) 
    (section 
  <A href="api_connect.html" target="_top">How to connect an Application</A> 
    explains this topic in detail),
    you can start sending commands to the API. 
    The 
  <A href="api_cmd.html" target="_top">Overview of API Commands</A>
    is a useful reference to browse through the command syntax.
    The commands are divided into categories with respect to their semantics. 
    They are built hierarchically with parenthesis according to the 
    category they belong to, e.g. command "menu(file(exit))" belongs to
    category "menu". 
    The following categories are available: 
  </P>

  <UL>
  <LI>
  <B>graph(...)</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    The 
  <A href="api_cmd_graph.html" target="_top">graph category</A> 
    covers commands to send and update graphs. 
    You can 
  <A href="api_cmd_graph.html#new_graph" target="_top">send a complete graph</A> 
    in 
  <A href="term.html" target="_top">term representation format</A> 
    or update the structure of an already loaded graph by 
  <A href="api_cmd_graph.html#update" target="_top">adding and deleting nodes and edges</A>. 
    Further, it is possible to
  <A href="api_cmd_graph.html#change_attr" target="_top">change the attributes</A>
    of existing nodes and edges 
  (<A href="term_attr.html" target="_top">more information about attributes</A>)
    and to 
  <A href="api_cmd_graph.html#change_type" target="_top">change the type</A>
    of nodes and edges
  (<A href="term_type.html" target="_top">more information about types</A>).
  <A href="api_cmd_graph.html#update_and_change_attr" target="_top">Graph updates and attribute modifications</A>
    can be combined to be performed in one step. 
  </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>multi(...)</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    The  
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html" target="_top">multi category</A> 
    covers commands to work with many graphs in different windows at the 
    same time.
    Please read the 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">introduction to multi-graph/view/window modes</A>
    for background information.
    In the multi category, commands are available to 
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#new_context" target="_top">open a new context</A>,
    i.e. to get a new empty base window where an additional graph can be
    visualized. 
    Each context (graph) has its own unique context ID. 
    In multi-graph mode, uDraw(Graph) maintains a current context state 
    which can be set with command
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#set_context" target="_top">multi(set_context(...))</A>.
    The current context specifies the graph that should be affected by all
    subsequent commands sent to the API. 
    On the other side, in multi-graph mode each answer from the API has a 
    preluding answer
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context" target="_top">context(...)</A> 
    to specify the graph where the event happened. 
    The multi-graph mode is entered as soon as the first context is opened. 
    If you intend to use more than one graph later in a session, you 
    should 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#initialization" target="_top">open the first context at initialization time</A>. 
  </P>
  <P>
    In multi-graph mode, you can only access each context (graph) on its 
    own, but you have no access to the individual base windows opened 
    in a context. 
    Especially the commands of the 
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html" target="_top">window category</A> 
    may not work as expected, because they only apply to the 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#master_view" target="_top">master view</A>
    of a context. 
    Accessing all base windows is only possible by using the
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#multi_window" target="_top">multi-window mode</A>
    that is available after using command-line option
  <A href="opt.html#window_api" target="_top">-window_api</A>
    by opening the first context.
    Here, the current context must be set with a different command 
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#context" target="_top">multi(set_context(...))</A>
    where both the context and window ID are specified. 
    The current context and window represent the graph and base window 
    that will be affected by subsequent commands sent to the API. 
    On the other side, in multi-window mode each answer from the API
    has a preluding answer
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context_window" target="_top">context_window(...)</A>
    to specify the graph and window where the event happened. 
    Further, in multi-window mode the application is informed about 
    creation and destruction of base windows by using the answers 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#open_window" target="_top">open_window</A> 
    and 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#close_window" target="_top">close_window(...)</A>.
  </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>menu(...)</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    The 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html" target="_top">menu category</A> 
    covers commands to call the menu functions of the uDraw(Graph) 
    user interface. 
    All these commands are further divided into subcategories with 
    respect to the menu they belong to: file, view, navigation, 
    abstraction, layout and option. 
  </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>app_menu(...)</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    The 
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html" target="_top">application menu category</A> 
    covers commands to let the application attach its own menus and icons 
    to the uDraw(Graph) user interface. 
    Please read the 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">introduction about user interface extension</A>
    for background information.
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#create_menus" target="_top">Application menus</A> 
    are always attached to the 
  <A href="gui_edit.html" target="_top">Edit menu</A> 
    and 
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#create_icons" target="_top">application icons</A> 
    are placed on a separate plane of the 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">icon bar</A>. 
    Using these commands is the traditional way to
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">extend the user interface</A>,
    but meanwhile it is also possible to 
  <A href="api_gui_config.html" target="_top">configure the whole user interface</A>
    with the commands of the
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html" target="_top">gui category</A>, 
    see below.
    Application menus and icons that are not applicable in a current state 
    should be disabled by the application. 
    This can be done with  
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#activate_menus" target="_top">activation commands</A>
    where the list of currently enabled menus/icons is specified;
    all the remaining menus/icons are automatically disabled.
    To interpose the file operations, the application can 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#interpose_file_events" target="_top">take control on the uDraw(Graph) file menu events</A>, 
    for example to store its own data structure when the user selects the 
    "File/Save" menu in uDraw(Graph). 
  </P>
  <P>
    The commands of this category are not available if the command-line 
    option 
  <A href="opt.html#nogui" target="_top">-nogui</A> 
    has been used. 
  </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>gui(...)</B>
<BR>
  <P> 
    The 
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html" target="_top">graphical user interface category</A> 
    covers commands to let the application configure all menus, icons and 
    footer areas of the uDraw(Graph) user interface. 
    Please read the 
  <A href="api_gui_config.html" target="_top">introduction about user interface configuration</A>
    for background information.
    The configuration has to be done at initialization time before the first
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">base window</A> 
    gets visible.
    Otherwise the base windows will only have the graph area and the 
    scrollbars without access to the other user interface elements 
    (menus, icons and footer). 
    There are  
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#activate_menus" target="_top">activation commands</A>
    for all menus and icons where the list of currently enabled menus/icons 
    is specified; all the remaining menus/icons are automatically disabled
    in this case.
    Further commands can be used to 
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#set_radio_menus" target="_top">set the values of radio menus and icons</A>. 
  </P>
  <P>
    The commands of this category are only available if the command-line 
    option 
  <A href="opt.html#nogui" target="_top">-nogui</A> 
    has been used. 
  </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>set(...)</B>
<BR>
  <P> 
    The 
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html" target="_top">set category</A> 
    covers commands to set different options of uDraw(Graph) which are
    usually manipulated by the user with the dialog windows of the 
  <A href="gui_opt.html" target="_top">option menu</A>.
    Commands are available to set the 
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#layout_accuracy" target="_top">accuracy</A>
    of the graph layout algorithm, 
    to 
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#keep_nodes_at_levels" target="_top">specify if the node levels should be preserved</A>
    by the layout algorithm,
    to set the
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#manual_layout" target="_top">fine-tuning constraints</A>,
    to specify the
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#font_size" target="_top">font size</A>,
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#edge_style" target="_top">edge style</A>,
    and 
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#gap_width" target="_top">distances</A>
    between nodes and edges in the graph visualization, 
    to control the 
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#scrolling_on_selection" target="_top">scrolling behavior</A>,
    to define the 
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#animation_speed" target="_top">speed of animation</A>
    used for scrolling,

    used in the print dialog and to define the
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#tooltip_delay" target="_top">tooltip delay</A>.
    One option that cannot be set in the user interface is
    the precedence used for visualization definitions, i.e. the
  <A href="conc_def.html" target="_top">attribute evaluation order</A>.
    The precedence can only be 
  <A href="api_cmd_set.html#rules_first" target="_top">set with an API command</A>.

  <LI>
  <B>window(...)</B>
<BR>
  <P> 
    The
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html" target="_top">window category</A> 
    covers commands to manipulate the 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">base windows</A>. 
    In 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph</A>
    mode, only the
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#master_view" target="_top">master view</A>
    is affected this way; use the
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#multi_window" target="_top">multi-window</A>
    mode if you want to manipulate any base window that is opened in a 
    context. The window category contains commands to set the

    to 
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html#show_message" target="_top">show messages</A>
    and 
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html#show_status" target="_top">status information</A>
    in the footer area, to set the

  </UL>

  <H2>Answers from the API</H2>
  <P>
    All commands sent to the API are confirmed after execution by 
    returning an answer which is usually 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#ok" target="_top">ok</A> 
    or
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#communication_error" target="_top">communication_error(...)</A> 
    when the command failed. 
    Some commands 
  (<A href="api_answ_info.html#commands_without_ok" target="_top">listed here</A>)
    return another confirmation answer instead of ok. 
    It is very important to wait for confirmation before sending the 
    next command, because in rare situations, the API accepts
    new commands even if the previous command is still in process 
    and not yet confirmed, so the confirmation answers may not
    appear in the right order afterwards. 
    The rest of the answers 
  (<A href="api_answ_all.html#event_answers" target="_top">listed here</A>)
    are events that are triggered by the user, e.g. to inform the 
    application about selection of a graph node. 
    Events can occur at any time, except when an API command is 
    currently executed and not yet confirmed. 
  </P>
  
  <A name="asynchronous"></A>
  <H2>Very important note about Asynchronization</H2>
  <P>
    Due to the strange effects of asynchronous communication caused by
    message delays, an event must also be expected by the application 
    after sending a command to the API and before receiving the 
    corresponding confirmation answer! 
    uDraw(Graph) guarantees that event answers are not propagated during 
    execution of an API command, but if the event occurred during transfer
    time of the command (i.e. after it is sent by the application and 
    before it is received by the API), then the event answer may 
    interfere and will arrive at the application side in the time 
    interval after sending the command and before receiving the
    corresponding confirmation answer. 
    So never expect that the confirmation answer will come back directly 
    after sending an API command. 
    Your application must accept event answers at any time! 
  <P>
  </P>
    Your application is responsible for handling an event answer. 
    The event may trigger an operation in the application or can simply
    be ignored. 
  </P>

  <A name="notes"></A>
  <H2>Important Notes about the API</H2>
  <P>
    Please consider the following facts when using the uDraw(Graph) API: 

  <UL>
  <LI>
  <B>
    No return characters inside API commands
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    API commands must not contain newline (ASCII 10) or return characters 
    (ASCII 13). 
    They must have exactly one newline at the end of the command 
    ("end-of-line") to flush the write buffer. 
    No other characters, even no spaces, should follow after this 
    concluding return, except of the next complete command. 
    When these restrictions are not considered, communication with the  
    API will likely fail. 
    For example, in "C" you can send a command to the API this way, 
    whereby "dv_fd" is a file descriptor of a pipe or socket to send 
    API commands to uDraw(Graph):
  </P>
  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <TR>
<TD class="table">fprintf(dv_fd,"window(show_message(\"Hi\"))\n");</TD>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
</P>
  <P>
    Note that there is a newline at the end of the "C" string and that 
    there is another API string inside the "C" string. 
    Quotes inside "C" strings have to be escaped with a backslash 
    character "\". 
    The same is true for quotes inside API strings, refer to the next 
    list item. 
  </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>
    No unescaped double quotes inside API commands 
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    Some API commands have a 
  <A href="api_param.html#string" target="_top">string</A> 
    parameter which is always enclosed by double quotes, 
    for example:
  </P>
  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <TR>
<TD class="table">window(show_message("This is a string"))</TD>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
</P>
  <P>
    If you have to use double quotes inside a string, make sure 
    that they are always escaped with a backslash character "\". 
    Example: 
  </P>
  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <TR>
<TD class="table">window(show_message("Here is a quote \" inside."))</TD>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
</P>
  <P>
    But do not escape the outermost double quotes of the string! 
  </P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>
    Use only balanced braces "{" and "}" in API commands 
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    Because Tcl/Tk is used for the implementation of the uDraw(Graph)
    user interface, some characters have a special meaning.
    Braces ("{" and "}") are used as delimiters for sending strings 
    to Tcl/Tk. 
    As a restriction, you cannot use unbalanced braces somewhere inside 
    of an API 
  <A href="api_param.html#string" target="_top">string</A>,
    even if they are escaped with "\". 
    Using strings like "}" or "{" inside of an API command will result 
    in Tcl/Tk error messages on command-line, whereas a balanced "{}" is 
    allowed.
    So you have to avoid sending strings with unbalanced braces.

    After 
  <A href="api_connect.html" target="_top">connecting an application</A>
    to the uDraw(Graph) API, the application program has to wait for the 
  <A href="api_answ_info.html#initialization" target="_top">initial ok answer</A>
    before sending any commands to the API.

    Disconnection
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    An application will receive the answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#disconnect" target="_top">disconnect</A>
    if the user selects menu
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Disconnect</A>. 
    The appropriate action for this event is to terminate the application 
    in order to let the user connect another application in uDraw(Graph).

    Multi-graph mode
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    In 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph mode</A>, 
    each answer has a preluding 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context" target="_top">context(...)</A>
    answer to specify the context (graph) where the event happened. 
    So, your application has to receive two answers at a time after 
    entering multi-graph mode. 
  </P>

    Multi-window mode
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    In 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#multi_window" target="_top">multi-window mode</A>, 
    each answer has a preluding  
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context_window" target="_top">context_window(...)</A>
    answer to specify the context (graph) and base window where the 
    event happened. 
    So, your application has to receive two answers at a time after 
    entering multi-window mode. 
    Further, the application is informed about creation (answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#open_window" target="_top">open_window</A>) 
    and destruction (answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#close_window" target="_top">close_window(...)</A>) 
    of all base windows.

    Close and exit when file events are controlled
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    When the application 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#interpose_file_events" target="_top">controls the "File" menu events</A>, 
    it will receive the following answer each time the user wants to 
    close a particular context (graph) by using menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Close</A>:
  </P>
  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <TR>
<TD class="table">menu_selection("#%close")</TD>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
</P>
  <P>
    The appropriate action in this case is to set the current context 
    (and window in multi-window mode) to the ID where the event happened
    and to close this context by sending command "menu(file(close))". 
    In the same way, the application will receive the following answer
    when the user wants to exit uDraw(Graph) by using menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Exit</A>:
  </P>
  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <TR>
<TD class="table">menu_selection("#%exit")</TD>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
</P>
  <P>
    The appropriate action in this case is to send 
    "menu(file(exit))" in any context to terminate uDraw(Graph).
