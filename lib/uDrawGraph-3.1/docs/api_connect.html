  <H1>How to connect an Application to the API</H1>
  
  <P>
    From a technical point of view, communication between uDraw(Graph) 
    and a connected application program is performed with two pipes.
    One is used to send commands to the uDraw(Graph) API, e.g. to transmit 
    graphs, to attach menus/icons or to call menu functions.
    The other one is used to receive the answers, e.g. return values, 
    user events, etc.
    Alternatively, bi-directional TCP/IP socket communication can be
    used where uDraw(Graph) acts as a socket server and the application 
    program is a socket client. 
    The following figure illustrates this approach: 
  </P>

  <P>
  
  <IMG border="1" alt="API communication types" width="" height="" src="uDG31_connect.gif">
  <BR>
  
    Types of API communication
  <BR>
  </P>

  <P>
    Only one application program can be connected with uDraw(Graph) at a time, 
    but this client process is able to visualize many graphs in different 
    windows at a time, see 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph/view/window modes</A>. 
    If there is a need to have many applications communicating with 
    uDraw(Graph) in a system architecture scenario, then the application 
    programmer has to provide a single "concentrator process" which 
    synchronizes the communication between uDraw(Graph) and all individual 
    applications.
  </P>

  <A name="pipe"></A>
  <H1>Communication with Pipes</H1>

  <H2>Choose which way to go</H2>

  <P>
    There are two options for connecting an application to the API with pipes. 
    Either uDraw(Graph) is doing this job, which is the easiest way, or 
    the application connects uDraw(Graph) in order to have more flexibility. 
    The point is whether uDraw(Graph) or the application is the parent process.
    The advantage of the first solution where uDraw(Graph) is responsible for
    establishing connection is that the application programmer does not have 
    to deal with process and pipe programming.
    In this case, all an application program has to do is sending commands 
    to the API by printing on the standard output ("stdout") and 
    receiving the answers from the API by reading from "stdin". 
    Further, if uDraw(Graph) has launched the application process, the user 
    will be able to disconnect the application later in order to connect 
    another one. 
  </P>
  <P>
    The disadvantage of this solution is that the application's "stdin" 
    and "stdout" have to be exclusively reserved for communication with
    uDraw(Graph). 
    If more flexibility is needed, e.g. to use other file descriptors 
    than "stdin" and "stdout", then the application has to establish 
    the communication with uDraw(Graph) on its own, 
  <A href="api_connect.html#pipe_by_application" target="_top">read below</A>
    for details. 
  </P>

  <A name="pipe_by_uDG"></A>
  <H2>Either uDraw(Graph) connects the Application...</H2>
  <P>
    uDraw(Graph) is able to connect an application program at start-up time 
    using command-line option 
  <A href="opt.html#startappl" target="_top">-startappl</A> 
    or at run-time with menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Connect Application...</A>. 
    By connecting an application, uDraw(Graph) forks a new process, creates 
    two pipes for communication, binds "stdin" and "stdout" of the new 
    process to the end of the pipes and finally starts the specified 
    application program.
    The application has to wait for the initial 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#initialization" target="_top">ok</A> 
    answer before commands are sent to the API.
    This is done by simply printing them on "stdout". 
    Answers from the API are available for the application by reading 
    from "stdin". 
  </P>
  <P>
    When the connection has been performed by uDraw(Graph), the user is 
    able to shutdown the currently connected application at any time 
    using menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Disconnect Application</A>. 
    But this only works in case of support by the application.
    It has to terminate after receiving answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#disconnect" target="_top">disconnect</A>. 
  </P>

  <A name="pipe_by_application"></A>
  <H2>... or the Application connects uDraw(Graph)</H2>
  <P>
    The application program has to start uDraw(Graph) on its own when the 
    more comfortable method of connection  
  (<A href="api_connect.html#pipe_by_uDG" target="_top">described above</A>) 
    is not suitable.
    To do so, the application has to perform the tasks described below
    (example code for establishing a pipe communication with uDraw(Graph) is 
    provided in the distribution, look at the directory "simpleclient" 
    in  "samples"):
  </P>
  <UL>
  <LI>
  <B>Forking a new process</B>
<BR> 
    This is the child process used for uDraw(Graph). 
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <B>Creating two pipes</B>
<BR>
    One to send commands and the other one to receive answers from the API.
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <B>Redirecting the file descriptors</B>
<BR> 
    "stdin" and "stdout" of the new child process (uDraw(Graph)) have to be 
    connected with one side of both pipes. 
    The parent process (application) has to connect two free file 
    descriptors to the other end of both pipes.
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <B>Start uDraw(Graph)</B>
<BR>
    Execute uDraw(Graph) with command-line option 
  <A href="opt.html#pipe" target="_top">-pipe</A> 
    in the forked child process. 
  </LI>
  </UL>
  <P>
  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> 
    the application has to set line-buffered I/O before starting
    communication with uDraw(Graph) via pipes. 
    For example, in "C" it can be done this way:
  </P>

  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" width="350">
<TR>
<TH COLSPAN="0">
    Setting line-buffered I/O in UNIX&reg;/Linux&reg;
  </TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD class="table">setbuf(stdout,NULL); setbuf(stdin,NULL);</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" width="350">

  </TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD class="table">setvbuf(stdin,NULL,_IONBF,0); setvbuf(stdout,NULL,_IONBF,0);</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

  <P>
    After establishing connection, uDraw(Graph) sends an initial 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#initialization" target="_top">ok</A> 
    answer for synchronization. 
    The application must not start sending commands to the API 
    before receiving this answer. 
    uDraw(Graph) is unable to disconnect the application if it has 
    not established the connection on its own. 
    So, menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Disconnect Application</A> 
    is always deactivated for the connection method described 
    in this paragraph. 
  </P>

  <H1>Communication with TCP/IP Sockets</H1>
  <P>
    A more flexible way of communication is to use TCP/IP sockets
    instead of pipes.
    This way it is even possible to start uDraw(Graph) and the application
    program on different computers in a network or even at different
    sites. 
    Please read the 
  <A href="api_connect.html#pipe" target="_top">chapter above</A> 
    about pipe communication as well, because some pieces of information mentioned
    there are relevant for any type of communication.
  </P>

  <H2>uDraw(Graph) operating in Socket Server Mode</H2> 
  <P>
    With socket communication, uDraw(Graph) always acts as the socket server 
    that listens on a specified port for connection requests from an 
    application. 
    Initiating the socket server mode can be done either at start-up
    time using command-line option 
  <A href="opt.html#server" target="_top">-server</A> 
    or at run-time with menu
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Connect Application ...</A>. 
    In both ways, the socket port can be specified where uDraw(Graph) 
    should listen for connection requests and subsequent API commands.
    If not specified, the standard port 2542 is used which has been 
    exclusively registered for uDraw(Graph) by the 
  <NOBR><A href="http://www.iana.org/" target="_blank">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</A></NOBR> 
    (IANA) since 1998.
    It is recommended to use this reserved standard port in order to avoid 
    conflicts with other socket services.
  </P>

  <P>
    After entering the socket server mode, uDraw(Graph) listens on the 
    specified port until a socket connection request is received from
    an application program. 
    Then the application is connected to the API and subsequent
    connection requests from other applications are ignored unless the 
    connected application disconnects, because only one application 
    can be connected to the API at a time. 
    After the application has disconnected, uDraw(Graph) will automatically 
    start listening again for connection requests when the command-line 
    option
  <A href="opt.html#server" target="_top">-server</A> 
    has been used or as soon as another application is connected 
    with menu
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Connect Application ...</A>
    in socket server mode.
  </P>
  <P>
    If a port ("old") has been specified with option
  <A href="opt.html#server" target="_top">-server</A> 
    and afterwards menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Connect Application ...</A>
    is used with a different port ("new"), 
    then uDraw(Graph) stops listening on the old port and immediately 
    starts listening on the new port. 
    After the application has disconnected in this case, uDraw(Graph) will
    start listening again on the old port.
  </P>

  <H2>Starting the Application as a Socket Client</H2>
  <P>    
    An application program can be connected to the API as a socket 
    client in two ways.	
    One option is to simply execute the application program stand-alone 
    after uDraw(Graph) has been started with command-line option 
  <A href="opt.html#server" target="_top">-server</A>.
    On the other hand, uDraw(Graph) can start the application by using menu
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Connect Application ...</A>.
    In this case, choose the communication type "TCP/IP Sockets" in the
  <A href="gui_file_connect_opt.html" target="_top">connection dialog</A>.
  </P>
  <P>    
    In both cases, the application has to set up the communication by
    connecting to the uDraw(Graph) socket port as client.
    The way this can be done depends on the implementation language
    and libraries used for the application.
    Please consult your documentation and programming manuals for details
    or search for socket programming tutorials in the Internet.
    Example code for establishing socket communication with uDraw(Graph) 
    is provided in the distribution, look under "simpleclient" in directory 
    "samples".
  </P>
  <P>    
    You can test the socket communication using the 
  <A href="edit.html" target="_top">graph editor application</A>
    that can act as a socket client with appropriate command-line options.
  </P>
  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <TR>
<TD class="table">uDrawGraph(.exe) -server</TD>
</TR>
  <TR>
<TD class="table">grapheditor(.exe) -client</TD>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
</P>
  <P>    
    This will connect the graph editor application to uDraw(Graph) using 
    sockets. Both programs can even be executed on different computers
    that are connected by a network.
  </P>

  <A name="transmit"></A>
  <H1>Testing API Transmission</H1>
  <P>
    After establishing a connection for the first time between your 
    application and uDraw(Graph), you should test the transmission by 
    sending command
  <A href="api_cmd.html#nothing" target="_top">nothing</A>
    several times to the API. 
    The connection works when you receive the answer "ok" as a reply 
    for each command that was sent to the API. 
    uDraw(Graph) only accepts valid commands according to the 
  <A href="api_cmd.html" target="_top">API syntax</A>.
    All other messages are treated as a syntax error by sending answer
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#communication_error" target="_top">communication_error</A>
    back to the application. 
    Tip: You can play with the API by starting uDraw(Graph) in a 
    command-line (i.e. shell) with option 
  <A href="opt.html#pipe" target="_top">-pipe</A>.
    Afterwards you can enter commands in the command-line to send 
    them to the API. 
    Do not forget to finish the command with the RETURN/ENTER key.
    The answers from the API are also displayed in the command-line 
    in this case. 
    You can find some examples for commands in the "samples/api" 
    directory of the distribution.
  </P>
  <P>
  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> 
    API commands must not have newline or return characters inside. 
    They must have exactly one newline at the end of the command. 
    No other characters, even no spaces must follow this concluding 
    return, except of the next complete command. 
    If these restrictions are not considered, communication with the 
    API will likely fail. 
  </P>
