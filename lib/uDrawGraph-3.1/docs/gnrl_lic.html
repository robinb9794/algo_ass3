sequel). The provider of the licence has developed the software
"<NOBR><A href="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph/" target="_blank">uDraw(Graph)</A></NOBR>" (just called "software" in the sequel). The

several support tools for the visualization of graphs.
  </P>
  <P>
Following the ideas of open source software, the licence
