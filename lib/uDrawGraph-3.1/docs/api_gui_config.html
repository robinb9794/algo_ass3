  <H1>User Interface Configuration</H1>
  
  <P>
    Configuring the user interface is a way to determine the
    appearance of all menus, the icon bar and the footer area of 
    the uDraw(Graph)
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">base windows</A>.
    So you can reorder the given menus and icons, insert your own
    application menus and icons at any position or remove the menus, icons
    or footer completely.
    Another option is to 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">extend the user interface</A>
    in the traditional way.
    Please refer to the chapter
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">User Interface Extension</A>
    to read about the motivation for extending or configuring the
    uDraw(Graph) user interface.
  </P>
  
  <H2>
    Configurable Parts of the User Interface
  </H2>
  <P>
    The 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">base window</A>
    has three configurable areas, namely the pull-down menus, the
    icon bar (with two planes) and the footer area where messages and
    status information is displayed.
    Additionally, the default
  <A href="gui_pop.html" target="_top">pop-up menu</A>
    and the handling of closing events for base windows can be configured.
    The configuration is done at initialization time by reading a 
    configuration file when uDraw(Graph) is started.
    In the configuration file, all visible parts have to be defined
    exactly once.
    Parts not mentioned there are removed from the user interface, so
    it is even possible to get base windows without menus, icons and 
    footer.
    A base window that is already visible cannot be reconfigured,
    so this has to be done at start-up time or when the corresponding
    context is opened in
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph mode</A>.
  </P>
  <P>
    With user interface configuration, an application program connected 
    to the API can add (or reorder or reduce) menus and icons 
    in any way.
    This is not possible with the traditional 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">user interface extensions</A>.
    Further, the application can define radio menus similar to the 
  <A href="gui_lay.html" target="_top">Layout/Orientation</A> 
    menu and radio icons similar to the last three icons of the 
    standard 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">icon bar</A>. 
  </P>

  <A name="config_file"></A>
  <H2>
    The User Interface Configuration File
  </H2>
  <P>
    Only one configuration file is used at a time, but you can have
    more to work with different settings.
    The name of a configuration file is arbitrary, but the suffix 
    of the filename has to be ".menu". 
    Please look at the description of the command
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#configure" target="_top">gui(configure(...))</A> 
    to read the details about location and naming of configuration 
    files. 
  </P>
  <P>
    The file must have one configuration command at each line according 
    to the 
  <A href="api_gui_config_syntax.html" target="_top">configuration file syntax</A>. 
    Some commands have parameters like basic types (e.g. string) or
    further commands. 
    Some commands have a corresponding "finish_..." command to 
    declare the end of the corresponding block.
    The easiest way to configure the user interface is to look at some
    examples.
    They are located in directory "$UDG_HOME/lib/uDrawGraph" of the 
    distribution.
    You can copy and edit them for your own purpose.
    The directory contains three user interface configuration files:
  </P>

  <UL>
  <LI>
  <B>File "uDrawGraph.menu"</B>
<BR> 
  <P>
    A configuration for the standard user interface of uDraw(Graph)
    that appears after every start without using command-line option
  <A href="opt.html#nogui" target="_top">-nogui</A>.
    The file is not actually used by the system, it only serves as
    an example.
  </P>
  </LI>    
  <LI>
  <B>File "uDrawGraph_cfe.menu"</B>
<BR> 
  <P>
    Same as above, but this is the standard user interface 
    that appears when a connected application has taken
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#control_file_events" target="_top">control of the file menu events</A>.
    There are some small differences regarding necessary activation 
    commands in order to get the same behavior known from previous
    releases when the
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#control_file_events" target="_top">file menu events are interposed</A>.
    Please read the
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#transition" target="_top">transition guideline</A>
    below for further details. 
  </P>
  </LI>    

  <LI>
  <B>File "gedit.menu"</B>
<BR> 
  <P>
    This is the actual user interface configuration used by the 
  <A href="edit.html" target="_top">graph editor application</A>. 
    It contains menus and icons for both the uDraw(Graph) standard operations
    and the graph editor operations attached to the "Edit" menu.
  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> 
    do not change this file without having a copy, because it is 
    used by the system when the graph editor is connected.
    Otherwise the user interface may be damaged.
  </P>
  </LI>
  </UL>

  <P>
    As you can see from the examples, it is even possible to rebuild 
    the complete user interface without losing any function of uDraw(Graph). 
    You can decide on your own about the user interface parts that are 
    kept, changed or removed.
  </P>

  <H2>Top-level Configuration Commands</H2>
  <P>
    By using a top-level command in the configuration file, you 
    declare the configurable part of the user interface.
    Unfinished commands of the previous top-level command are  
    automatically finished this way.
    Please refer to the 
  <A href="api_gui_config_syntax.html" target="_top">configuration file syntax</A>,
    too.
  </P>

  <UL>
  <A name="menubar"></A>
  <LI>
  <B>menubar</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    The menu bar is the part of the 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">pull-down menus</A>
    that is always visible. 
    It is the topmost area of the base window containing the entries
    "File", "Edit", etc.
    With the top-level command "menubar" you can define the whole 
    pull-down menu hierarchy, i.e. the menu bar and all the menus that
    can be reached from this point.
    The menu bar will not be visible when this top-level 
    command is not used in the configuration file.
    The "menubar" top-level command is followed by
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#menubar_commands" target="_top">menu bar configuration commands</A>
    and a final command "finish_menubar" to declare the end of this block.
  </P>
  </LI>

  <A name="popup_menu"></A>
  <LI>
  <B>popup_menu</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    To define the 
  <A href="gui_pop.html" target="_top">default pop-up menu</A>
    that appears when the 
  <A href="gui_mous.html#right" target="_top">right mouse button</A>
    is pressed over free space in the 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">graph area</A>
    or over a node/edge that does not have an own 
  <A href="term_nattr.html#menu" target="_top">pop-up menu</A> 
    using node/edge attributes.
    No default pop-up menu will be available when this top-level 
    command is not used in the configuration file.
    The "popup_menu" top-level command is followed by
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#menu_commands" target="_top">menu configuration commands</A>
    and a final command "finish_popup_menu" to declare the end of this block.
  </P>
  </LI>
    
  <A name="iconbar"></A>
  <LI>
  <B>
    iconbar 
  <A href="api_gui_config_syntax.html#which_iconbar" target="_top">which_iconbar</A>
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    To define the whole content of the 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">icon bar</A>
    at the left side of the base window.
    The icon bar has two planes, the regular plane ("first",  
    intended for built-in operations) and the application plane ("second",
    originally intended for icons sent by API command
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#create_icons" target="_top">app_menu(create_icons(...))</A>).
    When two planes are defined, the user will have a small arrow symbol 
    at the bottom of the icon bar to switch between both planes.
    You can use the "iconbar" top-level command twice in a configuration 
    file, i.e. one for each plane which is specified by parameter 
  <A href="api_gui_config_syntax.html#which_iconbar" target="_top">which_iconbar</A>.
    If only one plane is defined, then this will be the one that becomes
    visible in the base window, even if it is the "second".
    The icon bar will not be visible when this top-level 
    command is not used in the configuration file.
    The "iconbar" top-level command is followed by
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#iconbar_commands" target="_top">icon bar configuration commands</A>
    and a final command "finish_iconbar" to declare the end of this block.
  </P>
  </LI>

  <A name="message_bar"></A>
  <LI>
  <B>message_bar</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    To define that the base window should have a message bar. 
    The message bar is the left part of the footer area. 
    In the message bar, all standard text messages of uDraw(Graph) are
    displayed as well as the messages sent by an application with the
    API command
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html#show_message" target="_top">window(show_message(...))</A>.
    If this top-level command is not used in the configuration file, 
    uDraw(Graph) will not display any messages and the above API command 
    to show messages has no effect. 
    The footer area will not be visible in the base window when both
    the message and status bar are omitted in the configuration file.
    The "message_bar" top-level command has no parameters, so there is no 
    need to finish this command. 
  </P>
  </LI>

  <A name="status_bar"></A>
  <LI>
  <B>status_bar</B>
<BR>
  <P>
    To define that the base window should have a status bar. 
    The status bar is the right part of the footer area. 
    In the status bar, only messages are displayed that are sent by 
    an application with the API command
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html#show_status" target="_top">window(show_status(...))</A>.
    If this top-level command is not used in the configuration file, 
    the API command to show the status has no effect. 
    The footer area will not be visible in the base window when both
    the message and status bar are omitted in the configuration file.
    The "status_bar" top-level command has no parameters, so there is no 
    need to finish this command. 
  </P>
  </LI>

  <A name="close_event"></A>
  <LI>
  <B>close_event 
  <A href="api_gui_config_syntax.html#close_id" target="_top">close_id</A>
  <A href="api_gui_config_syntax.html#close_type" target="_top">close_type</A>
  </B>
<BR>
  <P>
    This top-level command can be used to define the behavior when a
    base window is closed, either by menu
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Close</A> 
    or the equivalent generic window function of the operating system
    respective window manager.
    With the "close_event" top-level command, the application will
    receive the answer 
    "menu_selection(&lt;close_id&gt;)" (where "close_id" is taken from
    the configuration file)
    and has to react either by closing the corresponding context or by
    ignoring the event, similar to the recommended action on the 
    "#%close" menu selection event  
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#recommended_actions" target="_top">described on the user interface extension page</A>.
    Make sure that the "close_id" is unique with respect to the other
    menu IDs in your configuration file.
    With the parameter "close_type", you can specify that the event will 
    be sent when any base window is closed ("window") or only when the
    last base window of a context is closed ("context").
    If the "close_event" toplevel command is not used, base windows 
    will be closed by uDraw(Graph) without notification. 
    The "close_event" command has a fixed number of parameters, so 
    there is no need to finish this command.

    To specify a regular entry in the menu bar. 
    All menu entries are added from left to right in the menu bar 
    according to the order of the menu commands in the menu bar part 
    of the configuration file. 
    The first parameter of this command is used to specify
    the label (text) of the menu and the second, which is optional,
    is a mnemonic character for 
  <A href="gui_keyb.html" target="_top">keyboard activation</A> 
    of the menu.
    The mnemonic character is either an integer or a 
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#language_key" target="_top">language key</A> 
    that maps to an integer.
    It specifies the n-th character of the label that should be used 
    as mnemonic, where "0" is the first character of the label and "-1" 
    means no mnemonic.
    The mnemonic character is underlined in the user interface. 
    This command has to be followed by 
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#menu_commands" target="_top">menu configuration commands</A>

    This menu is added to the menu bar according to a particular
    style-guide.
    On UNIX&reg; and Linux&reg; platforms, the help menu is always at the
    rightmost position of the menu bar and on Windows&reg; and Mac OS&reg; platforms
    it is the last entry in the menu bar, directly next to the previous entry.
    The label (text) of the help menu is predefined.
    On UNIX&reg; and Linux&reg;, it is the current value of the

  <A href="api_answ_all.html#menu_selection" target="_top">menu_selection(&lt;menu_id&gt;)</A>
    when the menu entry is selected by the user.
    This identifier can also be used in API command
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#activate_menus" target="_top">gui(activate_menus(...))</A>
    to enable the corresponding menu entry and in 
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#set_radio_menus" target="_top">gui(set_radio_menus(...))</A>
    to set the current value if the menu entry is part of a radio menu.
    Note that all menu identifiers must be unique in a configuration file.
    The second parameter specifies the label (text) for this entry. 
    The last three parameters are optional, where "mne" 
    specifies the mnemonic of this entry 
  (<A href="api_gui_config.html#menu" target="_top">see command "menu"</A>
    for details about mnemonics).
    The fourth parameter "modifier" specifies the modifier key for 
    the 
  <A href="gui_keyb.html" target="_top">keyboard accelerator</A> 
    of this entry (supported values are: "Control", "Shift", "Meta", "Alt", 
    "" or a

    With this command, an icon specific to an application program
    can be added to the icon bar. 
    The first parameter specifies the identifier of the icon that is
    send back to the application using API answer
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#icon_selection" target="_top">icon_selection(&lt;icon_id&gt;)</A>
    when the icon is selected by the user.
    This identifier can also be used in API command
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#activate_icons" target="_top">gui(activate_icons(...))</A>
    to enable the corresponding icon and in 
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#set_radio_icons" target="_top">gui(set_radio_icons(...))</A>
    to set the current value if the icon if part of a radio icon.
    Note that all icon identifiers must be unique in a configuration file.
    The second parameter "bitmap" specifies the file with the bitmap used 
    for the icon. 
    This can be a uDraw(Graph) system bitmap
    (the settings can be found in the configuration file of the 
    standard user interface in "$UDG_HOME/lib/uDrawGraph/uDrawGraph.menu")
    or a file name in one of the directories specified by environment 
    variable
  <A href="var.html#udg_icondir" target="_top">$UDG_ICONDIR</A>.
    The bitmap file used for icons must be in X11<SUP class="tm">TM</SUP> Bitmap format 
    (".xbm") with a size of 18x18 pixel. 
    The third optional parameter "help" is a short text or
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#language_key" target="_top">language key</A>
    mapping to a text that describes the semantic of the icon operation.
    The help text is automatically displayed in the footer area of the 
    base window as long as the mouse pointer is over the icon.

    With this command, a system icon available in the standard uDraw(Graph)
    user interface can be added to the icon bar. 
    The first parameter specifies the system function. 
    Please refer to the configuration file of the standard user interface 
    (in "$UDG_HOME/lib/uDrawGraph/uDrawGraph.menu") for the settings.
    The remaining parameters are the same as in command
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#icon_entry" target="_top">icon_entry</A>.
    System icons cannot be activated or deactivated by the 
    application, because they are handled by uDraw(Graph) according to 
    internal rules. 
    The application is not informed about the selection of this icon.

    This command is used for a group of icons with "radio button" 
    semantic like the last three icons in the icon bar of the standard
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">base window</A>
    where one icon of the group is selected at a time.
    The parameter "icon_var" is a unique identifier for the radio icon entry.
    At initialization time, no icon of the group is selected.
    Please use command 
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#set_radio_icons" target="_top">gui(set_radio_icons(...))</A>
    to set the initial value for all radio icons.
    Command "radio_icon_entry" is used to enclose the icon entries 
    that should belong to the group.
    This command has to be followed by 
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#icon_commands" target="_top">icon configuration commands</A> 
    and finished with a final "finish_radio_icon_entry" command
    after the last icon entry of the group.

    Regular Strings, Internationalized Strings and Language Keys

  <P>
    In the
  <A href="api_gui_config_syntax.html" target="_top">configuration file syntax</A>,
    you can find the non-terminal symbols "string" and "lang_string".
    Both are strings, enclosed by a double quote (").
    A "lang_string" can be a regular string or a language key that maps
    to a string.
    A string that is using a language key is called internationalized
    string, because the mapping can be exchanged in order to support 
    different languages.
    The chapter about
  <A href="int.html" target="_top">internationalization</A>
    describes this mechanism in detail.
    A language key always starts with "#%..." and is replaced by the
    value it currently maps to at run-time.
    Note that the non-terminal symbol "string" in the syntax must not be
    a language key.

  <A name="activation"></A>
  <H2>
    Activation and Deactivation of Menus and Icons
  </H2>
  <P>
    All menus and icons that are defined in a configuration file 
    are automatically deactivated after starting uDraw(Graph)
    (system menus/icons used in a configuration file are not affected).
    The application program has to activate them with the API commands 
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#activate_menus" target="_top">gui(activate_menus(...))</A>
    and 
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#activate_icons" target="_top">gui(activate_icons(...))</A>
    Both commands enable the menus (or icons) specified in the parameter
    and automatically disable all remaining application menus (or icons). 
  </P>
  <P>
    The system menus/icons are activated or deactivated by uDraw(Graph). 
    Menu entries defined with command 
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#submenu_entry" target="_top">submenu_entry</A>,
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#menu" target="_top">menu</A>
    and
  <A href="api_gui_config.html#help_menu" target="_top">help_menu</A>
    are only containers for other menu entries and do not need to be 
    manually activated by the application.
    They are automatically activated by uDraw(Graph) when at least one of
    their entries is activated and they are deactivated otherwise.
    Note that this feature is not available for the traditional way of
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">user interface extension</A>
    when submenus are created with API command
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#create_menus" target="_top">app_menu(create_menus(...))</A>.
  </P>

  <A name="transition"></A>
  <H2>
    Transition from User Interface Extensions 
  </H2>
  <P>
    If your application program has taken advantage of 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">user interface extensions</A>
    known from previous releases by using API command
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#control_file_events" target="_top">app_menu(control_file_events)</A>
    and you want to migrate to the user interface configuration described
    here, then you can simply use (or derive from) the predefined 
    configuration file "$UDG_HOME/lib/uDrawGraph/uDrawGraph_cfe.menu".
    For the dynamic part, simply use the API command
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#activate_menus" target="_top">gui(activate_menus(...))</A>
    instead of
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#activate_menus" target="_top">app_menu(activate_menus(...))</A>
    and
  <A href="api_cmd_gui.html#activate_icons" target="_top">gui(activate_icons(...))</A>
    instead of
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#activate_icons" target="_top">app_menu(activate_icons(...))</A>.
    In this case, your application program has to be modified at one point,
    because the following API command activates both the menus and icons
    of the corresponding operations:
  </P>
  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <TR>
<TD class="table">app_menu(activate_menus(["#%open","#%saveas","#%print"]))</TD>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
</P>
  <P>
    With user interface configuration this has to be done in two steps:
  </P>
  <P>
<TABLE border="0" bgcolor="#b6bfdd" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <TR>
<TD class="table">gui(activate_menus(["#%open","#%saveas","#%print"]))</TD>
</TR>
  <TR>
<TD class="table">gui(activate_icons(["#%open","#%saveas","#%print"]))</TD>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
