  <H1>Using the Mouse</H1>
  
  <P>
    In uDraw(Graph) you can use the three buttons of the mouse this way: 
  <UL>
  <LI>
    The left mouse button is used for selecting and moving items. 
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The middle mouse button is used for 2D-scrolling and drag &amp; drop. 
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The right mouse button is used for pop-up menu operations. 
  </LI>
  </UL>
  </P>
  <P>
    If your mouse has only two buttons there are two possibilities.
    On the Windows&reg; platform, the middle mouse button is simulated in
    uDraw(Graph) by keeping the CTRL-Key on the keyboard pressed while 
    using the left mouse button. 
    On the UNIX&reg; and Linux&reg; platform, you have to refer to the
    documentation of your X11<SUP class="tm">TM</SUP> environment to see how the middle 
    mouse button is simulated (often this is done by pressing both
    mouse buttons simultaneously).
    If you have a wheel mouse with two visible buttons, you might check 
    if the wheel can be pressed, because the wheel is often used
    as the middle mouse button. 
  </P>
  <P>
  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> On Mac OS&reg; X the standard mouse has only one
  button. This is the left mouse button described here. If you want to
  have access to the features described for the other mouse buttons,
  you have to install a 3-button mouse. We have noticed that middle
  and right mouse buttons are misbehaving for some products, because
  middle mouse button (or scrolling wheel) triggers the right mouse
  button event and the right mouse button triggers the middle mouse
  button event. For future releases we will try to have a better
  integration into Mac OS&reg;, hopefully even for one button.
  </P>

  <A name="left"></A>
  <H2>Left Mouse Button</H2>
  <P>
    As usually, this mouse button is used for any kind of selection, 
    activation, movement and for placing the text cursor. 
    In the 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">graph area</A> 
    of a uDraw(Graph) base window, this button is used to select nodes 
    and edges. 
    By holding the SHIFT key, more than one node can be selected at 
    the same time, but only one edge, so selection of multiple edges 
    is not available.
    After making a new selection, the old one is lost. 
    Many nodes can be selected in one step by using rubber band selection. 
    To do so, click on empty space in the graph area with the left mouse
    button and hold it. 
    Then move the mouse by still pressing the button.
    You can see a moving rectangular area on the screen (rubber band). 
    After releasing the mouse button, all nodes are selected
    which are completely inside this rectangle. 
  </P>
  <P>
    A user can extend or reduce the current selection by using the SHIFT
    key and the left mouse button simultaneously. 
    With SHIFT-select, you add or remove a particular node from the set 
    of currently selected nodes, depending on whether or not the node was 
    selected before. 
    In other words: With SHIFT, the old selection will not 
    be lost after a new selection.
    SHIFT selection also works in combination with rubber band selection. 
  </P>
  <P>
  <A href="conc_fin.html" target="_top">Fine-tuning</A>
    of a graph layout also works with the left mouse button. 
    Dragging a node (i.e. holding down the button while moving the mouse)
    can be used to place it at a new position, for example to customize
    the layout according to your own ideas. 
  </P>

  <A name="middle"></A>
  <H2>Middle Mouse Button (or equivalent operation with a 2-button mouse, see above)</H2>
  <P>
  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> 
    if you have only a 2-button mouse without emulation for the
    middle mouse button, then the functions of the middle mouse button 
    are not directly available for you. 
    But they are only accelerators for functions that can be accessed 
    elsewhere, too.
    Namely you can scroll with the vertical and horizontal scrollbars
    of the base window. 
    Instead of using drag &amp; drop, you can achieve the same insertion
    operations with the menus, for example in the graph editor application.
  </P>
  <P>
    The middle mouse button is used for moving and copying elements. 
    You can usually use the button to move (i.e. scroll) 
    the visible part of a graph area in a base window. 
    As long as you press the middle mouse button anywhere in the graph area, 
    the window will scroll in both dimensions at the same time when
    you move the mouse.
    This is called 2D-scrolling. 
  </P>
  <P>
    The optional 
  <A href="conc_dad.html" target="_top">drag &amp; drop mode</A> 
    is also controlled with the middle mouse button.
    An application program connected to the uDraw(Graph) API (for example
    the graph editor delivered with the distribution) 
    can activate the drag &amp; drop mode. 
    Afterwards, the 2D-scrolling is switched off and the middle mouse
    button is used for drag &amp; drop operations, for example to 
    connect two nodes with a new edge by dragging a line from one node
    to the other.
    This only works when an application program is connected to the API. 
  </P>

  <A name="right"></A>
  <H2>Right Mouse Button</H2>
  <P>
    This mouse button is used for working with pop-up menus. 
    By clicking with the right button in the graph area of a base window, 
    the user is able to select an operation by browsing through menus and 
    submenus and releasing the mouse button over the desired menu entry. 
    For acceleration, the graph area has a built-in pop-up menu with 
    some frequently used functions.
  </P>
  <P>
    Pop-up menus can also be used by an application program connected
    to the API.
    Here, nodes and edges in a graph can have a special 
  <A href="term_nattr.html#menu" target="_top">pop-up attribute</A>
    where the menu is defined. 
    This pop-up menu is displayed when the user selects the node
    or edge with the right mouse button.
    Instead of starting a built-in operation when the button is released
    over a menu entry, a callback information is sent back by the API
    to inform the application about the choice of the user.
    Then the application is free to decide what to do next, depending 
    on the context and choice.
    When the right mouse button is pressed on a node or edge which does not
    have this special attribute (the default), the regular pop-up menu 
    is displayed which is also available over free space of the 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">base window</A>.
