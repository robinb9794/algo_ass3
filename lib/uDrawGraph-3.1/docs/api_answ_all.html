  <H1>API Answers</H1>
  
  <P>
    For background information about the answers described on this page, 
    refer to the
  <A href="api_gui_config.html" target="_top">information about API answers</A> 
    in the corresponding section of the API reference.
  </P>
  <P>
    On this page, all answers of the uDraw(Graph) API are described. These 
    answers are sent back to an application program connected to the API. 
    Click here to get an 
  <A href="api_answ.html" target="_top">overview of all API answers</A>. 
  </P>

  <A name="ok"></A>
  <H2>
    ok
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to confirm the successful execution 
    of a command that was sent to the API. 
    Exceptions: the 
  <A href="api_answ_info.html#commands_without_ok" target="_top">commands listed here</A>
    do not return ok, they return another answer instead. 
    If the execution of a command has failed, then answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#communication_error" target="_top">communication_error(...)</A>
    is sent instead of "ok". 
    For synchronization, "ok" is also sent to the application at 
  <A href="api_answ_info.html#initialization" target="_top">initialization time</A>
    after the application has been successfully connected to uDraw(Graph). 
  </P>

  <A name="communication_error"></A>
  <H2>
    communication_error(<A href="api_param.html#string" target="_top">string</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to inform about a failure regarding the 
    previous command.
    In parameter "string", the application can find an error message describing 
    the reason for the failure. 
    Usually, an exception like this should not happen when the application
    meets all rules and restrictions of the commands sent to the API.
  </P>

  <A name="node_selections_labels"></A>
  <H2>
    node_selections_labels(<A href="api_param.html#node_ids" target="_top">node_ids</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to inform the application about selection 
    of nodes in the graph after using the following API commands: 
  </P>

  <UL>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#navigation_select_parents" target="_top">menu(navigation(select_parents(...)))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#navigation_select_parent" target="_top">menu(navigation(select_parent(...)))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#navigation_select_siblings" target="_top">menu(navigation(select_siblings(...)))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#navigation_select_children" target="_top">menu(navigation(select_children(...)))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#navigation_select_child" target="_top">menu(navigation(select_child(...)))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#navigation_navigator" target="_top">menu(navigation(navigator(...)))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#navigation_find" target="_top">menu(navigation(find(...)))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_special.html#select_nodes" target="_top">special(select_nodes(...)))</A>
  </LI>
  </UL>

  <P>
    Further, answer "node_selections_labels(...)" is sent to the application 
    as an event after the user has selected a set of nodes in the graph 
    visualization. 
    In the parameter "node_ids" of the answer, the application can find the 
    identifiers of all nodes that are currently selected. 
    These identifiers are specified in the 
  <A href="term.html" target="_top">term representation</A>
    of the graph. 
    Many nodes can be selected in uDraw(Graph) at a time, so the parameter of the answer
    is a list of identifiers. 
    The list is empty when the user has deselected all nodes. 
    After loading a graph, no node is selected by default. 
  </P>

  <A name="node_double_click"></A>
  <H2>
    node_double_click
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API after the user has selected a node twice 
    within a specific short time interval. 
    Note that the answer has no parameter because it refers to the previous node 
    selection. 
    So if the user clicks on a node with id "something" twice, then after the 
    first click uDraw(Graph) sends the answer node_selections_labels(["something"]). 
    When the second mouse click is detected within a short time interval, 
    uDraw(Graph) will send answer node_double_click to inform that the last selection 
    was a double click. 
  </P>

  <A name="edge_selection_label"></A>
  <H2>
    edge_selection_label(<A href="api_param.html#edge_id" target="_top">edge_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to inform the application about selection 
    of one edge in the graph after using the following API command: 
  </P>

  <UL>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_special.html#select_edge" target="_top">special(select_edge(...))</A>
  </LI>
  </UL>

  <P>
    Further, answer "edge_selection_label(...)" is sent to the application 
    as an event after the user has selected an edge in the graph 
    visualization. 
    In the parameter "edge_id" of the answer, the application can find the 
    identifier of the edge that is currently selected. 
    This identifier is specified in the 
  <A href="term.html" target="_top">term representation</A>
    of the graph. 
    Unlike nodes, only one edge can be selected at a time in uDraw(Graph), 
    so the parameter of this answer is not a list.
  </P>

  <A name="edge_selection_labels"></A>
  <H2>
    edge_selection_labels(<A href="api_param.html#node_id" target="_top">node_id</A>,<A href="api_param.html#node_id" target="_top">node_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This is an obsolete alternative form of answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#edge_selection_label" target="_top">edge_selection_label(...)</A>,
    see above.
    It is still available for backward compatibility in case of
    loading an old graph that does not have edge IDs.
    These IDs were recommended in previous V1.x versions, but not
    required.
    Since V2.x, these IDs are mandatory. 
    Your application should be able to handle answer 
    "edge_selection_labels(...)".
    The first parameter "node_id" is the parent and the second "node_id" 
    is the child node of the currently selected edge. 
  </P>

  <A name="edge_double_click"></A>
  <H2>
    edge_double_click
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API after the user has selected an 
    edge twice within a specific short time interval. 
    Note that the answer has no parameter because it refers to the 
    previous edge selection. 
    So if the user clicks on an edge with id "something" twice, then 
    after the first click uDraw(Graph) sends the answer 
    edge_selection_label(["something"]). 
    When the second mouse click is detected within a short time 
    interval, uDraw(Graph) will send answer edge_double_click to 
    inform that the last selection was a double click. 
  </P>

  <A name="menu_selection"></A>
  <H2>
    menu_selection(<A href="api_param.html#menu_id" target="_top">menu_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to inform the application 
    about selection of an application menu. 
    The application program is able to attach its own menu entries 
    to uDraw(Graph) using either
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">user interface extension</A>
    or
  <A href="api_gui_config.html" target="_top">configuration</A>.
    The "menu_id" found in the parameter of this answer
    is the identifier specified at creation time of the selected 
    menu. 
    The application is also able to
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#interpose_file_events" target="_top">control the uDraw(Graph) "File" menu</A> using command
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#control_file_events" target="_top">app_menu(control_file_events)</A>.
    In this case, answer "menu_selection(...)" is also used to
    inform the application about selection events in the "File" 
    menu. 
    Make sure to read the
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#recommended_actions" target="_top">recommended actions</A>
    in order to be able to handle this events correctly.
  </P>

  <A name="icon_selection"></A>
  <H2>
    icon_selection(<A href="api_param.html#icon_id" target="_top">icon_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to inform the application 
    about selection of an application icon. 
    The application program is able to attach its own menu icons 
    to uDraw(Graph) using either 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html" target="_top">user interface extension</A>
    or
  <A href="api_gui_config.html" target="_top">configuration</A>.
    The "icon_id" found in the parameter of this answer
    is the identifier specified at creation time of the selected 
    icon. 
  </P>

  <A name="popup_selection_node"></A>
  <H2>
    popup_selection_node(<A href="api_param.html#node_id" target="_top">node_id</A>,<A href="api_param.html#menu_id" target="_top">menu_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to inform the application 
    about selection of a pop-up menu of a node. 
    The application program is able to attach its own individual
    pop-up menu entries to each node by setting the 
  <A href="term_nattr.html#menu" target="_top">pop-up menu attribute</A>.
    The "node_id" found in the parameter of this answer is the 
    identifier of the node where the pop-up menu was selected.
    The "menu_id" is the identifier specified at creation time of 
    the selected menu. 
  </P>

  <A name="popup_selection_edge"></A>
  <H2>
    popup_selection_edge(<A href="api_param.html#edge_id" target="_top">edge_id</A>,<A href="api_param.html#menu_id" target="_top">menu_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to inform the application 
    about selection of a pop-up menu of an edge.
    The application program is able to attach its own individual
    pop-up menu entries to each edge by setting the 
  <A href="term_eattr.html#menu" target="_top">pop-up menu attribute</A>.
    The "edge_id" found in the parameter of this answer is the 
    identifier of the edge where the pop-up menu was selected.
    The "menu_id" is the identifier specified at creation time of 
    the selected menu. 
  </P>

  <A name="context"></A>
  <H2>
    context(<A href="api_param.html#context_id" target="_top">context_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is sent by the API only in 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph mode</A>.
    It is used to specify the context (i.e. graph) where the
    event happened. 
    The event answer itself will be sent afterwards with the following
    answer, see concept of
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#two_answers" target="_top">two answers in multi-graph mode</A>
    The "context_id" found in the parameter of the answer is the 
    context identifier which has been assigned at creation time 
    using the commands 
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#new_context" target="_top">multi(new_context)</A>
    or 
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#open_context" target="_top">multi(open_context)</A>.
    The identifier can be used with command
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#set_context" target="_top">set_context(...)</A>
    to set the context (graph) affected by subsequent commands.
    If your application does not want to deal with more than one 
    graph at a time, i.e. when it does not enter the multi-graph mode 
    by opening a first context, then it will never receive the 
    context answers. 
  </P>

  <A name="context_window"></A>
  <H2>
    context_window(<A href="api_param.html#context_id" target="_top">context_id</A>,<A href="api_param.html#window_id" target="_top">window_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is sent by the API only in 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#multi_window" target="_top">multi-window mode</A>.
    It is used to specify the context (i.e. graph) and window where 
    the event happened. 
    The event answer itself will be sent afterwards with the following
    answer, see concept of
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#two_answers" target="_top">two answers in multi-window mode</A>
    The "context_id" found in the first parameter of the answer is the 
    context identifier which has been assigned at creation time 
    using the commands 
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#new_context" target="_top">multi(new_context)</A>
    or 
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#open_context" target="_top">multi(open_context)</A>.
    The "window_id" in the second parameter is automatically assigned
    by uDraw(Graph). 
    It is passed to the application with the preluding answer of
    answer
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#open_window" target="_top">open_window</A>
    at the time when a new base window is opened.
  </P>

  <A name="open_window"></A>
  <H2>
    open_window
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API only in 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#multi_window" target="_top">multi-window mode</A>
    to inform the application about a new base window in a
    context (graph). 
    This is done to confirm the following API commands: 
  </P>

  <UL>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#view_open_new_view" target="_top">menu(view(open_new_view))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#view_open_survey_view" target="_top">menu(view(open_survey_view))</A>
  </LI>
  </UL>

  <P>
    Further, this answer is sent to the application as an event 
    after the user has opened a new base window. 
    The window ID is automatically assigned by uDraw(Graph) 
    and can be taken from the preluding 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context_window" target="_top">context_window(...)</A>
    answer that has been sent directly before this answer.
  </P>

  <A name="close_window"></A>
  <H2>
    close_window(<A href="api_param.html#window_id" target="_top">window_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API only in 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#multi_window" target="_top">multi-window mode</A>
    as an event after the user has closed a base window. 
    The window ID parameter is the identifier of the closed window. 
    After closing a window, the window ID cannot be used any further.
    Afterwards, the application has to open a new window or specify 
    one of the remaining windows to be the new current window in the
    context.
    All other commands will be ignored, because after closing, the 
    current window will be undefined as long as a new one is not
    specified. 
  </P>

  <A name="tcl_answer"></A>
  <H2>
    tcl_answer(<A href="api_param.html#string" target="_top">string</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to pass results or 
    information from   
  <A href="api_tcl.html" target="_top">Tcl/Tk scripts</A>
    back to the application. 
    These scripts can be sent to the uDraw(Graph) Tcl/Tk interface 
    by using the following API commands: 
  </P>

  <UL>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_tcl.html#eval" target="_top">tcl(eval(...))</A>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <A href="api_cmd_tcl.html#eval_file" target="_top">tcl(eval_file(...))</A>
  </LI>
  </UL>

  <P>
    Both commands return "tcl_answer(...)" for confirmation rather than 
    the usual "ok" answer. 
    The string in this answer is the return value of the Tcl/Tk script 
    after finishing execution. 
    uDraw(Graph) is blocked while executing these scripts.
    On the other hand, "tcl_answer(...)" may also occur as an event at 
    any time. 
    The uDraw(Graph) Tcl/Tk interface offers the opportunity to
    send arbitrary messages back to the application via the API by using 
    a special Tcl-command inside of a Tcl/Tk script.
    These messages are forwarded by uDraw(Graph) to the application with 
    API-answer "tcl_answer(...)". 
  </P>

  <A name="browser_answer"></A>
  <H2>
    browser_answer(<A href="api_param.html#string" target="_top">string</A>,<A href="api_param.html#string" target="_top">string</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API to confirm the API command 
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html#file_browser" target="_top">window(file_browser(...))</A>. 
    uDraw(Graph) is blocked until the user has closed the file browser.
    In the first string parameter you can find the chosen (absolute)
    filename and the second string contains the last setting of the 
    type menu in the file browser. 
    Both strings of the answer are empty when the user has canceled 
    the browser. 
  </P>

  <A name="create_node"></A>
  <H2>
    create_node
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API only in
  <A href="api_dad.html" target="_top">drag and drop mode</A>
    to inform the application that the user has released the middle 
    mouse button over a free area and that no node was selected when 
    the middle mouse button was pressed before.
    The coordinates where the mouse button is released are stored 
    internally in uDraw(Graph) and can be reused when the commands
  <A href="api_cmd_dad.html#new_node_at_coord" target="_top">drag_and_drop(new_node_at_coord(...))</A> 
    or
  <A href="api_cmd_dad.html#new_node_and_edge_at_coord" target="_top">drag_and_drop(new_node_and_edge_at_coord(...))</A>
    are sent to the API.
    The recommended behavior to react on this event is to insert a
    new node at the mouse position by using 
    the command
  <A href="api_cmd_dad.html#new_node_at_coord" target="_top">drag_and_drop(new_node_at_coord(...))</A>.
  </P>

  <A name="create_node_and_edge"></A>
  <H2>
    create_node_and_edge(<A href="api_param.html#node_id" target="_top">node_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API only in
  <A href="api_dad.html" target="_top">drag and drop mode</A>
    to inform the application that the user has released the middle 
    mouse button over a free area and that the node with the given
    "node_id" was selected when the middle mouse button was pressed
    before.
    The coordinates where the mouse button is released are stored 
    internally in uDraw(Graph) and can be reused when the commands
  <A href="api_cmd_dad.html#new_node_at_coord" target="_top">drag_and_drop(new_node_at_coord(...))</A> 
    or
  <A href="api_cmd_dad.html#new_node_and_edge_at_coord" target="_top">drag_and_drop(new_node_and_edge_at_coord(...))</A>
    are sent to the API.
    The recommended behavior to react on this event is to insert a
    new node at the mouse position that is connected to the existing 
    node supplied in the parameter "node_id" with a new edge by using 
    the command
  <A href="api_cmd_dad.html#new_node_and_edge_at_coord" target="_top">drag_and_drop(new_node_and_edge_at_coord(...))</A>.
  </P>

  <A name="create_edge"></A>
  <H2>
    create_edge(<A href="api_param.html#node_id" target="_top">node_id</A>,<A href="api_param.html#node_id" target="_top">node_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API only in
  <A href="api_dad.html" target="_top">drag and drop mode</A>
    to inform the application that the user has released 
    the middle mouse button over a node (second "node_id")
    and that the node with the first "node_id" was selected 
    when the middle mouse button was pressed before.
    The recommended behavior to react on this event is to insert 
    a new edge between the first and the second node by using 
    command
  <A href="api_cmd_graph.html#update" target="_top">graph(update(...))</A>. 
  </P>

  <A name="drop_node"></A>
  <H2>
    drop_node(<A href="api_param.html#node_id" target="_top">node_id</A>,<A href="api_param.html#context_id" target="_top">context_id</A>,<A href="api_param.html#window_id" target="_top">window_id</A>,<A href="api_param.html#node_id" target="_top">node_id</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API only in
  <A href="api_dad.html" target="_top">drag and drop mode</A>
    to inform the application that the user has released 
    the middle mouse button over a node (second "node_id")
    or free area (second "node_id" is empty, i.e. "")
    and that a node (first "node_id") was selected when 
    the middle mouse button was pressed together with the
    SHIFT-Key.
    The coordinates where the mouse button is released are stored 
    internally in uDraw(Graph) and can be reused when the commands
  <A href="api_cmd_dad.html#new_node_at_coord" target="_top">drag_and_drop(new_node_at_coord(...))</A> 
    or
  <A href="api_cmd_dad.html#new_node_and_edge_at_coord" target="_top">drag_and_drop(new_node_and_edge_at_coord(...))</A>
    are sent to the API.
    The second ("context_id") and third parameter ("window_id")
    belong to the first "node_id" and specify the origin of the
    drag and drop operation.
    The destination is the second "node_id". Its context and
    window ID can be taken from the preluding 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context_window" target="_top">context_window(...)</A>
    answer.
    There is no recommended behavior to react on this event. 
  </P>

  <A name="disconnect"></A>
  <H2>
    disconnect
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API after the user has selected menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Disconnect</A>. 
    When this event happens, the application is obliged to terminate,
    so the user is able to connect another application to the API.
    Disconnection is only possible when uDraw(Graph) has established the 
    API connection, e.g. by using menu
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Connect Application...</A>
    or command-line option
  <A href="opt.html#startappl" target="_top">-startappl</A>.
  </P>

  <A name="close"></A>
  <H2>
    close
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is returned by the API only in 
   <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph mode</A>.
    or 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html#multi_window" target="_top">multi-window mode</A>
    to inform the application that the current context (i.e. graph) has 
    been closed. 
    This can be done either by the application itself using API command
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_close" target="_top">menu(file(close))</A> 
    or by the user with menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Close</A>. 
    After closing a context, the corresponding graph and all of its views
    (base windows) will be removed and the corresponding context ID 
    cannot be used any further. 
    Afterwards, the application has to open a new context or specify one 
    of the remaining contexts to be the new current context. 
    All other commands will be ignored, because after closing, the current 
    context will be undefined as long as a new one is not specified. 
    So answer "close" is either sent as result to confirm command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_close" target="_top">menu(file(close))</A> 
    or as an event at any time if the user has selected menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Close</A>
    in the last open view  of a context. 
    If it is not appropriate to allow that the user can close a context
    on his own, then the application can 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#interpose_file_events" target="_top">control the events of the File menu</A> 
    to interpose before the context is actually closed. 
    The context ID of the closed context can be taken from the preluding 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context" target="_top">context(...)</A>
    answer (or
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context_window" target="_top">context_window(...)</A>
    answer in multi-window mode)
    that was sent directly before. 
  </P>

  <A name="quit"></A>
  <H2>
    quit
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is sent by the API on termination, e.g. when the user has 
    selected menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Exit</A>.
    At this time, the application should stop sending further commands 
    to the API. 
    If it is not appropriate to allow the user to exit 
    uDraw(Graph) on his own, then the application can 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#interpose_file_events" target="_top">control the events of the File menu</A> 
    to interpose before uDraw(Graph) is actually terminated. 
  </P>

  <A name="version"></A>
  <H2>
    version(<A href="api_param.html#string" target="_top">string</A>)
  </H2>
  <P>
    This answer is sent by the API on command 
    <A href="api_cmd_special.html#version" target="_top">special(version)</A>.
    In parameter "string", the application can find  a description of the version of uDraw(Graph).
    For more information see
    <A href="api_cmd_special.html#version" target="_top">special(version)</A>.
