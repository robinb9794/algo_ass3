  <H1>User Interface Extension</H1>
  
  <P>
    Extending the user interface is the traditional way to add application 
    specific menus and icons at a predefined places in the uDraw(Graph) 
    user interface.
    It is even possible to 
  <A href="api_gui_config.html" target="_top">configure the whole user interface</A>
    of uDraw(Graph), so it is a good idea to look at this more flexible 
    mechanism first.
  </P>

  <H2>
    Why attaching Menus and Icons to the uDraw(Graph) User Interface?
  </H2>
  <P>
    By extending uDraw(Graph) with application specific menus and icons, 
    an application program connected to the API can offer the user a way
    to start operations (processed by the application itself) by
    interacting with a uDraw(Graph) graph visualization.
    So the user has the same kind of menu access to both the standard
    visualization operations offered by uDraw(Graph) and to operations 
    that modify the graph structure and have to be executed by the 
    application program. 
  </P>
  <P>
    For example, an application might add a menu named "Delete Node". 
    If the user selects this menu in the uDraw(Graph) user interface, the
    application is informed about this event by receiving the answer
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#menu_selection" target="_top">menu_selection(...)</A>
    from the API. 
    With respect to the current node selection (which has been propagated 
    by the API before with answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#node_selections_labels" target="_top">node_selections_labels(...)</A>),
    the application is able to remove the selected node(s) in its own data 
    structure. 
    Afterwards, the application has to send one of the commands of the 
  <A href="api_cmd_graph.html" target="_top">graph category</A>
    back to the API to inform uDraw(Graph) about its modifications to the graph
    in order to update the visualization. 
    Even with this trivial example, uDraw(Graph) has been extended by 
    the functions of a simple graph editor without the need to provide 
    the necessary code inside the visualization system. 
    This way, uDraw(Graph) is as flexible and generic as possible to be 
    extended by any kind of function, depending on the behavior of an 
    application that is connected to the API. 
  </P>

  <A name="application_menus"></A>
  <H2>Adding Application Menus and Icons</H2>
  <P>
    An application is able to attach menus in the uDraw(Graph) user interface
    at any time by sending command
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#create_menus" target="_top">app_menu(create_menus(...))</A>. 
    It is even possible to add more menus later in a session, although 
    this is not a recommended practice with respect to human computer 
    interaction guidelines. 
    uDraw(Graph) will always attach these application menus in the 
  <A href="gui_edit.html" target="_top">Edit menu</A> 
    hierarchy, because these operations should usually have to do with 
    modification of the structure of a loaded graph. 
    Each time the user selects an entry of a menu that is provided by 
    the application, answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#menu_selection" target="_top">menu_selection(...)</A>
    is sent back by the API to inform about this event. 
    Afterwards, the application can perform any appropriated task to 
    handle the event, e.g. by manipulating its own data and sending 
    commands to the API. 
  </P>
  <P>
    Application icons, added by using the API command 
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#create_icons" target="_top">app_menu(create_icons(...))</A>
    are always attached on a separate plane of the 
  <A href="gui_base.html" target="_top">icon bar</A>.
    The other (default) plane of the icon bar, visible at start-up time, 
    is reserved for the built-in icons which are shortcuts to 
    frequently used menu operations. 
    The user can 
  <A href="tut_edit_start.html#switch_planes" target="_top">switch between both icon planes</A>
    by clicking on the arrow at the lower side of the icon bar. 
    As soon as the API receives the first icons, the application plane and 
    the arrow become visible automatically.
    Each time the user selects an icon that is provided by the application, 
    answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#icon_selection" target="_top">icon_selection(...)</A>
    is sent back by the API to inform about this event. 
    Afterwards, the application can perform any appropriated task to 
    handle the event, e.g. by manipulating the own data and sending 
    commands to the API. 
  </P>
  <P>
    In 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph mode</A>, 
    each context (i.e. graph) has its own menus and icons. 
    To guarantee that the user interface is consistent, application 
    menus and icons cannot be removed later. 
    If particular menu entries or icons are not applicable in a 
    current situation (e.g. with respect to the current node or 
    edge selection in uDraw(Graph)), the application should deactivate 
    them by using the commands 
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#activate_menus" target="_top">app_menu(activate_menus(...))</A>. 
    and 
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#activate_icons" target="_top">app_menu(activate_icons(...))</A>. 
    Both activation commands enable the menus (or icons) specified in 
    the command's parameter and automatically disable all remaining 
    application menus (or icons). 
  </P>

  <A name="interpose_file_events"></A>
  <H2>
    A closer Integration by Interposing the File Menu Events
  </H2>
  <P>
    The application is unable to attach its menus in uDraw(Graph) at other 
    places than the "Edit" menu, 
    with the exception of 
  <A href="api_gui_config.html" target="_top">user interface configuration</A>
    at initialization time.
    This might be inappropriate for I/O operations, for example if 
    the applications would like to have a menu to save its own data 
    structure. 
    With respect to most user interface style guides, such an operation 
    should usually be available in the "File" menu. 
    After connecting an application to the API, uDraw(Graph) will disable 
    most of the entries in the 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File</A>
    menu to avoid a situation where the user can load a different graph 
    without permission by the application. 
  </P>
  <P>
    If desired, the application can use command 
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#control_file_events" target="_top">app_menu(control_file_events)</A>
    to take control of all entries of the "File" menu,
    except for 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Connect Application</A>
    and 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Disconnect Application</A>.
    After doing so, the application will receive events with the
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#menu_selection" target="_top">menu_selection(...)</A>
    answer as soon as any entry of the "File" menu is selected by the user. 
    After losing control of the "File" menu, uDraw(Graph) will not perform 
    any operation if these menu entries are selected by the user. 
    Instead, the application has to decide on its own what to do. 
    To simulate the built-in behavior on these events, read the 
  <A href="api_gui_extend.html#recommended_actions" target="_top">recommended actions</A>
    below. 
    The entries of the "File" menu have special predefined menu IDs 
    (with prefix "#%") which are used in the string parameter of the
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#menu_selection" target="_top">menu_selection(...)</A>
    answer in case of selection.
    These reserved menu IDs cannot be used as identifier for 
    application menus.
  </P>

  <P>
    These menu IDs can be used with command 
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#activate_menus" target="_top">app_menu(activate_menus(...))</A>
    to enable or disable the corresponding entries in the "File" menu. 
    Of course, "File" menu events not applicable in the current situation
    can simply be ignored by the application, but it is better to 
    deactivate these menu entries for ergonomic reasons.
  </P>
  <P>
  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> 
    each time the command 
  <A href="api_cmd_app_menu.html#activate_menus" target="_top">app_menu(activate_menus(...))</A>
    is sent to 
    the API, all the other menus not listed in the command's parameter 
    list will be automatically deactivated, even in the "File" menu 
    (but of course only if the application has taken control of the 
    "File" menu). 
    So an application programmer must always consider the entries of 
    the "File" menu with each menu activation, because otherwise the 
    user might not be able to exit uDraw(Graph) when menu "File/Exit" has 
    automatically been disabled this way. 
  </P>
  <P>
  <STRONG>Very important:</STRONG> 
    After taking control of the "File" menu events, 
    the application is responsible for closing a context and quitting
    uDraw(Graph) when the user selects the corresponding operation, i.e. menu
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Close</A>
    (or the equivalent generic window function of the operating system
    respective window manager)
    and 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/Exit</A>.
    In this case, the answer menu_selection("#%close") respective
    menu_selection("#%exit") is sent to the application which should 
    usually be handled by performing the recommended actions that are 
    listed directly below. 
    The user will not be able to close windows or exit uDraw(Graph) if 
    the application ignores these events.
  </P>

  <A name="recommended_actions"></A>
  <H2>Recommended Actions on File Events</H2>
  <P>
    If the application controls the "File" menu 
  (<A href="api_gui_extend.html#interpose_file_events" target="_top">read above</A>)
    and the user selects an entry of this menu, then uDraw(Graph) does 
    not perform any operation. 
    Instead, the event is forwarded to the application by using the 
    API answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#menu_selection" target="_top">menu_selection(...)</A>.
    At this time, the application has to decide what to do. 
    For example, if menu 
  <A href="gui_file.html" target="_top">File/New</A> 
    is selected, the application will receive the answer 
    menu_selection("#%new"). 
    An appropriate behavior to handle this event might be to clear the 
    application's internal graph data structure and send an empty graph 
    back to uDraw(Graph). 
  </P>
  <P>
    If the application would like to simulate the built-in behavior 
    that is usually executed in case of file events, it can do so by 
    sending the following API commands back to the API:
  </P>
  
  <UL>
  <LI>
  <B>Menu event "File/New"</B>
<BR>
    The application receives the answer menu_selection("#%new").
    Clear the graph in uDraw(Graph) by sending command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_new" target="_top">menu(file(new))</A>. 
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>Menu event "File/Open..."</B>
<BR>
    The application receives the answer menu_selection("#%open").
    Use a file browser in "open" mode with command 
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html#file_browser" target="_top">window(file_browser(...))</A>
    and wait for answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#browser_answer" target="_top">browser_answer(...)</A>. 
    Load the selected file by using command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_open_graph" target="_top">menu(file(open_graph(...)))</A>
    or 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_open_status" target="_top">menu(file(open_status(...)))</A>
    with the filename returned with the browser answer. 
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>Menu event "File/Save"</B>
<BR>
    The application receives the answer menu_selection("#%save").
    Save the status of the graph that is currently loaded in uDraw(Graph)
    with command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_save_status" target="_top">menu(file(save_status(...)))</A>. 
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>Menu event "File/Save As..."</B>
<BR>
    The application receives the answer menu_selection("#%saveas").
    Use a file browser in "save" mode with command 
  <A href="api_cmd_window.html#file_browser" target="_top">window(file_browser(...))</A>
    and wait for answer 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#browser_answer" target="_top">browser_answer(...)</A>. 
    Save the loaded graph in term representation or status format 
    (depending on the selected type in the browser answer) by using command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_save_graph" target="_top">menu(file(save_graph(...)))</A> 
    or 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_save_status" target="_top">menu(file(save_status(...)))</A>
    with the filename returned by the browser answer. 
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>Menu event "File/Print..."</B>
<BR>
    The application receives the answer menu_selection("#%print").
    Open the print dialog window with command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_print" target="_top">menu(file(print))</A>.
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>Menu event "File/Export..."</B>
<BR>
    The application receives the answer menu_selection("#%export").
    Open the export dialog window with command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_export" target="_top">menu(file(export))</A>.
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>Menu event "File/Close"</B>
<BR>
    The application receives the answer menu_selection("#%close").
    Close the current context (i.e. graph) by sending command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_close" target="_top">menu(file(close))</A>.
    This menu should only be available in 
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph mode</A>. 
    Never close a context in single-graph mode! 
  </LI>

  <LI>
  <B>Menu event "File/Exit"</B>
<BR>
    The application receives the answer menu_selection("#%exit").
    Terminate uDraw(Graph) with command 
  <A href="api_cmd_menu.html#file_exit" target="_top">menu(file(exit))</A>.
    Maybe you should exit your application program, too.
 </LI>
  </UL>

  <P>
  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> 
    in
  <A href="api_multi_modes.html" target="_top">multi-graph mode</A>,
    you also have to consider the context of the menu event sent 
    to the application in a preluding 
  <A href="api_answ_all.html#context" target="_top">context(...)</A>
    answer. 
    The current context must be set using command 
  <A href="api_cmd_multi.html#set_context" target="_top">multi(set_context(...))</A>
    to the context ID returned by the event answer before sending 
    the next command. 
    Otherwise, the reaction of your application may affect other graphs
    than the one where the event actually happened.
